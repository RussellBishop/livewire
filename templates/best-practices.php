                Selling beer into export markets can carry a degree of risk based on the longevity of the supply chain as well as the complexities of the destination market. However, brewers considering export trade can take steps to significantly reduce this risk through developing an understanding of those markets that are being considered and by developing an export plan.

<p>Research into foreign markets should consider the entire supply chain route from brewery gate to final point of sale.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not sell your beers without undertaking due diligence of the market.</li><li>Visit the market, if possible before and after product is exported. This is invaluable in ensuring the integrity and quality of product and understanding the consumer, dispense challenges, and suitability of beer style to market.</li><li>Ensure that logistics from your brewery to the export market are fit for purpose so that the quality of beer at dispense point is as you, the brewer, intends. It is important to ensure that beer is protected from excessive changes in temperature (both heat and cold). Where possible, temperature-controlled storage i.e. refrigeration should be considered. Don’t rely on weather patterns to regulate the temperature of your product.</li><li>Descants should also be considered to avoid damage to labels or potential for rust forming during transportation and storage.</li><li>Control the quality of your product as much as possible, from brewery gate to point of dispense.</li><li>Investigate where other brewers are having success.</li><li>Remember to factor keg return costs into the price of your beer. One trip kegs can offer savings in transportation costs.  Or, look for reciprocal arrangements with brewers in export market so kegs can be back-filled for return journey. Where such arrangements can be found, consideration should be made to the style and type of beer being back-filled and compatibility with the original brewer and risks of cross contamination i.e. presence of wild yeasts or other microorganisms.</li><li>In new, emerging markets export smallpack to start OR invest in the training of local staff, including wholesalers/distributors, in the handling of your draught beer.</li><li>Be firm on “best before” dates. Ensure your best practice is acceptable, taking into account the beer style, length of journey to market, storage temperature en route and within the final market.</li><li>Ensure your importers/wholesalers/distributors/retailers know the “story” of your beer and can convey this to the consumer/buyer. Have a budget to cover market visit costs to endorse/input your story.</li>
