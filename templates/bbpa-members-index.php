            The BBPA is the leading organisation representing the brewing and pub sector in the UK. We already represent around 90% of the beer brewed here and just under half of the UKâ€™s pubs. As a BBPA member, you are uniquely placed to shape the strategic direction of the sector, campaign for change on the issues that matter to you most, and come together with like-minded people to champion the sector that we all love. Upon joining the BBPA, you will receive a guide to help you make the most of your membership. Whether you are an international brewer or a small and ambitious pub company, we would be happy to talk to you about becoming a member.
