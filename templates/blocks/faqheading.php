        <p>Firstly, go to the Welcome Fair at the start of Term 1. Here you can find out all the information you need to know about clubs and societies, including the membership fees. If you miss that, don't worry! We have a full directory of clubs and societies online.</p>

        <p>There's also ‘Try’ fortnight, where most clubs offer free taster sessions for the two weeks, and sports clubs put on trials for two weeks! After those two weeks, there’s ‘Joining’ fortnight. Clubs and societies must have at least 30 members to exist, so join up quickly, and tell all your friends to join too. Each club has a membership fee (explained below), and you can buy your membership online. When the payment has been processed, your name and contact information will be passed onto the club president. If you don’t have a credit or debit card, you can still pay the membership fee in cash, at the CSC Reception.</p>
